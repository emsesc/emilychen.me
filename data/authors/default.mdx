I recently finished my first year of college at UNC Chapel Hill! I'm heading to Nashville, TN for a few days and then I'll be spending the rest of the summer in Cleveland, MS working with the Delta Center for Culture and Learning.

With [Bit Project](https://bitproject.org), we were successfully able to run our first iteration of the NFT Heist Severless Workshop last semester!
